abstract: '(177)Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan is a novel antibody-radionuclide conjugate
  currently in a phase 1/2a first-in-humans dose escalation trial for patients with
  relapsed CD37-positive indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The aim of this study was
  to investigate biodistribution and absorbed doses to organs at risk. Methods: In
  total, 7 patients treated with (177)Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan were included for
  dosimetry. Patients were grouped on the basis of 2 different predosing regimens
  (with and without predosing with 40 mg of lilotomab) and were treated with different
  levels of activity per body weight (10, 15, and 20 MBq/kg). All patients were pretreated
  with rituximab. Serial planar and SPECT/CT images were used to determine time-activity
  curves and patient-specific masses for organs with (177)Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan
  uptake. Doses were calculated with OLINDA/EXM. Results: The organs (other than red
  bone marrow and tumors) with distinct uptake of (177)Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan were
  the liver, spleen, and kidneys. The highest uptake was found in the spleen, with
  doses ranging from 1.54 to 3.60 mGy/MBq. The liver received 0.70-1.15 mGy/MBq. The
  kidneys received the lowest dose of the source organs investigated, 0.16-0.79 mGy/MBq.
  No statistically significant differences in soft-tissue absorbed doses were found
  between the two predosing regimens. The whole-body dose ranged from 0.08 to 0.17
  mGy/MBq. Conclusion: The biodistribution study for patients treated with (177)Lu-lilotomab
  satetraxetan revealed the highest physiologic uptake to be in the liver and spleen
  (besides the red marrow). For all treatment levels investigated, the absorbed doses
  were found to be modest when compared with commonly assumed tolerance limits.'
