abstract: '177 Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan is a novel antibody radionuclide conjugate
  currently tested in a phase 1/2a first-inhuman dosage escalation trial for patients
  with relapsed CD371 indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The aim of this work was to develop
  dosimetric methods and calculate tumor-absorbed radiation doses for patients treated
  with 177 Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan. Methods: Patients were treated at escalating
  injected activities (10, 15 and 20 MBq/kg) of 177 Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan and
  with different predosing, with or without 40 mg of unlabeled lilotomab. Eight patients
  were included for the tumor dosimetry study. Tumor radioactivity concentrations
  were calculated from SPECT acquisitions at multiple time points, and tumor masses
  were delineated from corresponding CT scans. Tumor-absorbed doses were then calculated
  using the OLINDA sphere model. To perform voxel dosimetry, the SPECT/CT data and
  an in-house-developed MATLAB program were combined to investigate the dose rate
  homogeneity. Results: Twenty-six tumors in 8 patients were ascribed a mean tumor-absorbed
  dose. Absorbed doses ranged from 75 to 794 cGy, with a median of 264 cGy across
  different dosage levels and different predosing. A significant correlation between
  the dosage level and tumor-absorbed dose was found. Twenty-one tumors were included
  for voxel dosimetry and parameters describing dose-volume coverage calculated. The
  investigation of intratumor voxel doses indicates that mean tumor dose is correlated
  to these parameters. Conclusion: Tumor-absorbed doses for patients treated with
  177 Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan are comparable to doses reported for other radioimmunotherapy
  compounds. Although the intertumor variability was considerable, a correlation between
  tumor dose and patient dosage level was found. Our results indicate that mean dose
  may be used as the sole dosimetric parameter on the lesion level.'
