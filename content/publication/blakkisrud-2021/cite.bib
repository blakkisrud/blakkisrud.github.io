 abstract = {Background: The aim of this study was to investigate dosimetry data and clinical variables to predict hematological toxicity in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients treated with [177Lutetium]Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan. Material and methods: A total of 17 patients treated with [177Lu]Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan in a first-in-human phase 1/2a study were included. Absorbed dose to the red marrow was explored using SPECT/CT-imaging of the lumbar vertebrae L2–L4 over multiple time points. Percentage reduction of thrombocytes and neutrophils at nadir compared to baseline (PBN) and time to nadir (TTN) were chosen as indicators of myelosuppression and included as dependent variables. Two models were applied in the analysis, a multivariate linear model and a sigmoidal description of toxicity as a function of absorbed dose. A total of 10 independent patient variables were investigated in the multivariate analysis. Results: Absorbed dose to the red marrow ranged from 1 to 4 Gy. Absorbed dose to the red marrow was found to be the only significant variable for PBN for both thrombocytes and neutrophils. The sigmoid function gave similar results in terms of accuracy when compared to the linear model. Conclusion: Myelosuppression in the form of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia in patients treated with [177Lu]Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan can be predicted from the SPECT/CT-derived absorbed dose estimate to the red marrow.},
