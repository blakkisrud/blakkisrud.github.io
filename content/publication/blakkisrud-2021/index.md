abstract: 'Background: The aim of this study was to investigate dosimetry data and
  clinical variables to predict hematological toxicity in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)
  patients treated with [177Lutetium]Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan. Material and methods:
  A total of 17 patients treated with [177Lu]Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan in a first-in-human
  phase 1/2a study were included. Absorbed dose to the red marrow was explored using
  SPECT/CT-imaging of the lumbar vertebrae L2–L4 over multiple time points. Percentage
  reduction of thrombocytes and neutrophils at nadir compared to baseline (PBN) and
  time to nadir (TTN) were chosen as indicators of myelosuppression and included as
  dependent variables. Two models were applied in the analysis, a multivariate linear
  model and a sigmoidal description of toxicity as a function of absorbed dose. A
  total of 10 independent patient variables were investigated in the multivariate
  analysis. Results: Absorbed dose to the red marrow ranged from 1 to 4 Gy. Absorbed
  dose to the red marrow was found to be the only significant variable for PBN for
  both thrombocytes and neutrophils. The sigmoid function gave similar results in
  terms of accuracy when compared to the linear model. Conclusion: Myelosuppression
  in the form of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia in patients treated with [177Lu]Lu-lilotomab
  satetraxetan can be predicted from the SPECT/CT-derived absorbed dose estimate to
  the red marrow.'
