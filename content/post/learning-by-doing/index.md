As a good [4H-er](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-H) , I am a big fan of "learning by doing", which can be extended to learning by teaching. Some weeks ago I listened to a talk where the adage "learn one, do one, teach one" was deemed old fashioned. But I kind of like it.

## (Continued) introduction

This post is to get an overview of what is possible with the HUGO site builder. The scaffolding was made with a small, self-made script that generates a template from a csv-file - maybe I will share the script but I would guess there are thousands of similar small scripts so I won't clutter the space further (send me an email if you want a link to it though [email](mailto:johbla@ous-hf.no))

Now, I can make text, paragraphs (line break, white space, line break), maybe even bulleted lists using 

```
# Todo
- Send some eamils
- Write more descriptive bullet points
```

and they will render nicely:

- Send some emails
- Write more descriptive bullet points.

Lets try to do something math-y, as we can explore how to insert figures, tables, code and math-expressions.

## The paper

We are going to use the paper by Ivashchenko et. al. "Time-Activity data fitting in molucular: Methodology and pitfall", published in Physica Medica in 2024. [Link to the paper on pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38052710/)
